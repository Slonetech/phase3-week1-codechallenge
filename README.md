# phase3-week1-codechallenge

## Description
this is a code challenge for phase 3 week 1 that has three parts:
1. a function that converts a 12 hour time string to a 24 hour time string
2. a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.
3. a function that a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substring. For example: "zodiacs" returns 26, as "z" and "d" are the two highest valued consonants (z=26, d=4, 26+4=30), which is greater than "z" and "c" (c=3) (26+3=29).
